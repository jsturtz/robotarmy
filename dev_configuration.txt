Unhiding windows folders
	Search for "Hidden" in windows
    	Under Files and Folders > Hidden files and folders, select the option to Show hidden files, folders and drives.

Installing Python

	Recommended version: 3.6.8 (PySimpleGUI recommends this version)
	https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/
	Download and run the Windows x86-64 installer
	Check "Add to Path".
	Do the standard install (comes with tk/tcl)
	Take note of install location. Should be something like C:/Users/jsturtz/AppData/Local/Programs/Python36

Windows PATH:
    In windows search box, search for "PATH". Edit environment variables -> PATH.
    Move the newly added python.exe to top of PATH (this prioritizes this python interpreter over any other installs)
    Copy the same path just below but append \Scripts (this is for pipenv.exe later)

Installing Pipenv
	Open up command prompt. Type python.exe to confirm PATH is correctly set to py 3.6.8.
	python.exe -m pip install pipenv

FIXME: DO we need to install git and configure in PyCharm?
