Unhiding windows folders
	Search for "Hidden" in windows
    	Under Files and Folders > Hidden files and folders, select the option to Show hidden files, folders and drives.

Installing Python

	Recommended version: 3.6.8 (PySimpleGUI recommends this version)
	https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/
	Download and run the Windows x86-64 installer
	Check "Add to Path".
	Do the standard install (comes with tk/tcl)
	Take note of install location. Should be something like C:/Users/jsturtz/AppData/Local/Programs/Python36

Windows PATH:
    In windows search box, search for "PATH". Edit environment variables -> PATH.
    Move the newly added python.exe to top of PATH (this prioritizes this python interpreter over any other installs)
    Copy the same path just below but append \Scripts (this is for pipenv.exe later)

Installing Pipenv
	Open up command prompt. Type python.exe to confirm PATH is correctly set to py 3.6.8.
	python.exe -m pip install pipenv

FIXME: DO we need to install git and configure in PyCharm?

Create a github account

Setting up PyCharm as a dev environment

	Install PyCharm

    Register github account
        Ctrl-Alt-S -> VCS -> Github -> Add account
        Set default

	Sync with github repo
		VCS -> Check Out From Version Control -> Git
		Enter the URL: https://github.com/jsturtz/robotarmy
		This should be set as your current PyCharm project

	Configure Python Virtual Environment in PyCharm
		Ctrl-Alt-S to open Settings
		Projects -> Project Interpreter -> Settings icon -> Add
		Click "Pipenv Executable"
		In the Base Interpreter, enter the path for the install location of python.exe
		Check "Show Hidden Files and Directories"

		Check "Install packages from Pipfile"

	Configuring entry point for program execution
		"Add Configuration" -> "+"
		Choose main.py in Script path, make sure RobotArmy Pipenv selected
		Click execute to run first program!

Install Postgres Server for Windows
    Install latest here: https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads
    Pick an easy password
    Make sure pgAdmin is checked
    You can skip stack builder
    ADD C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\12\bin to the PATH variable
    ADD C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\12\data to the PATH variable
    Create environment variables:
        Variable=PGDATA
        Value=C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\12\data

        # FIXME: Should keep password in settings.conf but I was having trouble with this
        Variable=PGPASSWORD
        Value=<password>

    Run cmd.exe as administrator
        -> pg_ctl start
    (You can also start/stop the postgres service by going to Services -> postgres x64-12)

    Run pgAdmin 4
    Open server -> right click database -> create
        Database=robotarmy
        Comment=Database for robotarmy application

    Create a configuration called Build Database in pycharm to execute build-db.py

Theme Browser
    I put a file in the root directory called "theme-browser.py" that you can run to see and set
    different PySimpleGUI themes. Create an execution config called "Theme Browser" pointing
    to this file. Execute this browser to see and set new themes.

Settings.conf
    This file we will use to store settings so that we don't replicate hardcoded values for things.
    So far, there are only two categories: [connection] for db connection info and [gui] for the
    color theme.
