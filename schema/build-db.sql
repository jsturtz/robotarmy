/*
generic_rubric_elements works differently than rubric_elements.
Here, the (title, is_max_scoring) will be the primary key, so don't try to insert multiple instances
of the same title. The idea is that if you need to use these with variable contents, then you should wrap any
variables in curly braces. Then, crucially, for any assignment that uses these generic rubric elements,
you must insert a new record into assignment_generic_rubric_variables to hold the variables for each assignment.
So for instance, since "Resources" requires a {number} of pages, then you must insert a record into
assignment_generic_rubric_variables with json that says '{number=2}'. If a particular generic rubric element
does not have variable interpolation, then you must still insert a new record but with the variable field
set to an empty json object.

Please review my remarks in the rubric for more information about your grade.  Here, we are looking at the efficacy of social media within the context of one specific company. As we entered away the course, it is important to begin to think like a marketer. Within this context, social media is less about keeping up with friends and family or the news or even sharing funny things from your day-to-day, but more about how companies engage customers. Putting a marketing mindset on will help you throughout the course. :-) Here is a great article on the subject: https://hbr.org/2019/08/to-win-support-for-your-idea-think-like-a-marketer\n\nAs we go, please know that I am invested in you and in your success.

You might even tell all your friends and family about this great deal and let them know to rush over to also purchase the top-of-the-line smart phone for one dollar. If you are entrepreneurial, you may even purchase some extra smart phones to resell.\n\nBut! Hang on! If companies actually sell smart phones for one dollar, they will be bankrupt quickly.
